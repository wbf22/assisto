# Assisto

Assisto is a great way to make a basic website and server without having to know how to code. It is really just an interface with chatgpt
that manages your conversation and automatically applies chatgpt's changes to your website. (It may still be good to have a developer to
help you at times, or you can learn some of that yourself as well. chatgpt is a great way to learn that kind of thing)

When you run the executable for your machine (Linux, Mac, Windows), a editor web page will open. You can then choose whether to run the app
as a published website, or in edit mode.


# Deploying
You can deploy as a published website by copying these files to your server:

```
editor
  |__ ...
your_website
  |__ ...
assisto
```


And then run the executable ('assisto') and selecting to run as a published website. Your website will then be running on port you select.
